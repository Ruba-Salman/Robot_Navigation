# Robot_Navigation
In this task, we will use SLAM map that we created before to navigate the robot to a specific point or location.

**Open the terminal to do these steps:**

### 1. For Launch Simulation World <br/>

$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger <br/>
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

### 2. Run Navigation Node <br/>

$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger <br />
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml

### 3. Estimate Initial Pose <br/>

-From the RViz menu, select 2D Pose Estimate. <br/>
-Click and drag the large green arrow toward the direction the robot is pointing on the map where the actual robot is positioned. <br/>
-Repeat steps 1â€“2 until the LDS sensor data is visible on the stored map.

at the end, the robot will move to the direction where the green arrow is indicated.
